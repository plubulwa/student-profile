                    <h4>Position Description</h4>
                    <p>
                        This role is a full stack engineering role for a company
                        specialising in science education. Working with a team of
                        engineers, the role would involve the creation and development
                        of teaching and support materials for science education in schools.
                        This organisation prides teamwork, work life balance, as well as a
                        systematic approach to solution design. Based in Melbourne, the
                        company is expanding into the US market with their educational
                        programs, and so exposure to international opportunities is also available.
                    </p>
                    <br></br>
                    <h4> Skills, Qualifications and Experience Required</h4>
                    <p>The senior engineer role requires many years of experience in the industry,
                        as well as having deep knowledge in a range of technical areas.
                        As this organisation is run by and consists mainly of software engineers,
                        this role would be highly focussed in terms of the technical requirements
                        needed. The role advertised also mentioned the need for experience in the
                        successful completion of projects.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p>The technical stack required mentioned the use of the following technologies:</p>
                    <ul>

                        <li>AWS</li>
                        <li>Terraform</li>
                        <li>Rust</li>
                        <li>CI on Buildkite</li>
                        <li>Ruby and Sorbet API (not Rails)</li>
                        <li>React and TypeScript front end</li>
                        <li>Protobuf interfaces</li>

                    </ul>
                    <br></br>
                    <h4>Skills, Qualifications and Experience I Have</h4>
                    <p>In which I state that I have nothing...</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            I am in the process of learning React – in
                            fact this profile page is coded in React as a way of
                            urthering my knowledge with the technology.
                        </li>
                        JavaScript/ Java – I have working intermediate knowledge
                        <li>
                            Have started to learn the basics of cloud computing at RMIT
                            which starts to cover the AWS requirements of the role advertised.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            I have experience in the work place working in small to medium
                            teams in a variety of sectors, which I believe will be an advantage to a
                            possible application for the role.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <br></br>
                    <h4>How do I get the skills</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            A lot of the skills are covered in the courses for my current
                            degree program. Some of them may not be covered in assessment. For example,
                            I am this semester studying a subject covering the foundations of cloud
                            computing, which covers some of the technologies mentioned in this job add (AWS)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Self-learning - Project generation.
                            <br />
                            One of the ways that I like to learn is to generate a problem, which covers a gap in
                            my learning, and then attempt to make this project. This process also highlights gaps
                            in my knowledge which need to be fixed.
                            <br />
                            Another way that I have utilised is by emulating or copying existing experiences
                            (without looking at the source code). This has pushed my coding into trying top
                            figure out how a thing works, and what is required.
                            <br />
                            The handy thing about working in this way is that these examples, whilst not
                            original, are recognisable to people, and can highlight code patterns, code
                            skill, and the ability to generate a finished product, without having to
                            completely create something from scratch.

                        <br />
                        I have learnt a lot of code by myself online – either from tutorials or reading the API. 
                        Nearly all code languages have online documentation with which you can start to learn the 
                        syntax of language and develop your skills.

                        <br/>
                        A few friends and acquaintances are already working in various IT spaces – whether its in 
                        software engineering or user design. They are a very good source of feedback and guidance in 
                        terms of what to learn next.
